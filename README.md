# LUX Academy Week 1 Project

## Overview

This project is part of the LUX Academy Week 1 curriculum. The week 1 notebook contains various exercises and examples designed to teach fundamental data analysis and visualization skills using Python.

# Structure of the Notebook
The notebook is divided into several key sections:

1. Introduction: An overview of the objectives and a brief introduction to the tools and libraries used.
2. Data Loading and Exploration: Steps to load and explore the dataset, including initial data inspection and summary statistics.
3. Data Cleaning: Processes to handle missing values, data type conversions, and other data preprocessing tasks.
4. Data Analysis: In-depth dataset analysis, including various statistical tests and exploratory data analysis (EDA).


# Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries installed:

pandas

NumPy

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy 


# Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the notebook file LUX_Academy_Week_1_Project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

# Data

The dataset used in this project is embedded within the notebook. It includes various meteorological readings such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The data is time-stamped, allowing for time series analysis.

# Key Functions and Methods

## Data Loading: Functions to read data from CSV files and load them into pandas DataFrames.
## Data Cleaning: Methods to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and incorrect data types.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Techniques to summarize the main characteristics of the data using visual and quantitative methods.

# Results
The notebook includes various visualizations and statistical analyses that provide insights into the dataset. Key findings are summarized in the conclusion section.

# Conclusion
This notebook serves as a practical introduction to data analysis with Python. It guides the user through the entire process, from data loading and cleaning to analysis.
